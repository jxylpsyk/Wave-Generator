# Import correct libraries
import simpleaudio as sa

# The Wave class is going to have all aspects of wave like frequency, amplitude, wave type and equation of wave
# This can be modified according to how external libraries work

from wave_class import Wave

# So the basic structure is to have a Wave object, on which all the computation/equations will be done.
# This is then passed to sa.play_buffer() as a sound which can then be heard.
# WE ARE DOING AS LESS LIBRARY-DEPENDENT COMPUTATION AS POSSIBLE. IMPERATIVE!!

idk examine later
